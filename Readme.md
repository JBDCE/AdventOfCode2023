# Advent of Code 2023

This documents my efforts on the advent of code 2023.

Programming Language of choice this year is C++.


## Steps for getting started developing C++ code on windows.

Yes windows. I develop on Windows because I hate myself.

TLDR:
 - Install MSYS2
 - Run this command in the shell that opens when starting clang64.exe ```pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-toolchain```
 - Say yes to whatever it says
 - Add the bin directory to the windows path
 - Open a new terminal and type ```gcc --version``` to check for success
